# Android UI Package
This is a package inspired by Material UI and React Structure for Android.
Android UI provides some pre-configured components for making android app
development faster.

Android UI comes with a ```Router``` functionality to speed up page changing
and reduce the activities needed in an application. Which also makes it easy
to set a **Root Layout** for the application that all the pages will use.
